# Task Manager
Personal TODO / Task Management program

Basically, a way to manage projects in a much more agile manner.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this Repo
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:alexlapinski/gist-tool.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies via NPM
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the project
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    This will start both the front-end and backend. 
    *You may need to also start the database (DynamoDB via Docker/Docker Compose).*
4. Open the browser to ```http://localhost:3000```
